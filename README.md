üìä COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization using Python

I‚Äôm excited to share my recent Data Analytics project where I explored global COVID-19 data to uncover meaningful insights using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

üîç Project Highlights:

Data cleaning & preprocessing of real-world COVID-19 dataset.

Analyzed top countries by confirmed, recovered, and active cases.

Calculated death & recovery rates across regions.

Created WHO region-wise distribution charts.

Performed correlation analysis between key metrics.

üìà Key Visualizations:

Bar charts for top affected and recovered countries.

Heatmap showing correlation of COVID-19 metrics.

Pie chart of active cases distribution.

WHO region-wise confirmed cases comparison.

üí° Skills & Tools Used:
Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | Plotly | Data Analysis | Data Visualization

This project improved my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights and present them visually in a clear, impactful way.
